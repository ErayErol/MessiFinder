### 1. The Connection string 
is in `appsettings.json`. If you use SQLEXPRESS, you should replace `Server=.;` with `Server=.\\SQLEXPRESS;`

### 2. Seeding sample data
would happen once you run the application, including Test Accounts:

  - Mini Football Field Manager: manager@manager.com / password: 123456
